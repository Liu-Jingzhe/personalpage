Hello! I am currently a PhD student of computer science at Michigan State University, advised by Professor Jiliang Tang. Before that, I got my bachelor's degree in electrical and computer engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in August 2023.
My research interests lie in applying machine learning techniques to understand real-world complex networks.
